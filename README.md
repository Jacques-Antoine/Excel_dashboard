I created this dashboard project with my own data that compares OPEX and the Budget for a company (HAZEN) throughout an entire financial year. It includes four informative visuals that reveal the company's cash flow.
Firstly, there's a dynamic bar chart that adjusts based on the selected month. It illustrates where the company is allocating its funds in various expense categories, allowing you to identify trends over the year.
Next, there's a chart displaying Expenses and Budget side by side, with an additional line indicating the variance between actual spending and the budget. This feature highlights areas of alignment or deviation.
For a quick overview, I added a couple of cards presenting the total OPEX and total Budget. Additionally, you can compare this year's OPEX to the previous year's.
For those interested in in-depth analysis, there's a Line chart that acts as a magnifying glass. You can select an expense category and observe its monthly fluctuations. This tool is valuable for detecting trends and investigating numbers.
Lastly, there's a unique sunburst chart, resembling a modified pie chart. It breaks down expenses by quarters for this year and the previous year, providing insights into any changes or disruptions.
(NB: This dashboard is 100% me â€“ no models, no shortcuts. Every bit of data and design is all mine. No borrowing, just my own hard work and creativity.)
